          <h4>Effile Tower, Paris</h4>
         <p>The Eiffel Tower is stunning in pictures, but seeing the majestic tower in real life is a jaw-dropping experience. Ironically, the Eiffel Tower was once the subject of protests by French artists, who called it “useless and monstrous.” Today, the Tour Eiffel is one of the most recognizable structures in the world, and a beautiful part of the Paris cityscape. We recommend skipping the long lines and heading straight up to the summit to get a bird’s eye view of Paris. At sunset, hop on an evening cruise around the Seine to watch the Eiffel Tower light up the Parisian night sky.

         <h4>Pont Alexandre III</h4>
         <p>Stretching across the Seine, Pont Alexandre III is an ornate arch bridge that connects Paris 7th and 8th arrondissements. The bronze street lamps you see have been powered by electricity since the bridge's construction in the 19th century. Pont Alexandre III was designed to reflect the Beaux-Arts-style of the Grand Palais, and features many intricate statues of nymphs and cherubs. Gilded winged horses sit atop four pillars, acting as a stabilizing counterweight. Learn more about Pont Alexandre III and uncover more hidden gems on this private tour around Paris.</p>

          <h4>Arc De Triomphe</h4>
          <p>The Arc de Triomphe is one of the most famous monuments in Paris, France, standing at the western end of the Champs-Élysées at the centre of Place Charles de Gaulle, formerly named Place de l'Étoile—the étoile or "star" of the juncture formed by its twelve radiating avenues. The location of the arc and the plaza is shared between three arrondissements, 16th (south and west), 17th (north), and 8th (east). The Arc de Triomphe honours those who fought and died for France in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, with the names of all French victories and generals inscribed on its inner and outer surfaces. Beneath its vault lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I.

          <h4>The Louvre Museum, Paris </h4>
          <p>The Louvre , or the Louvre Museum , is a national art museum in Paris, France. It is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the city's 1st arrondissement (district or ward) and home to some of the most canonical works of Western art, including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The museum is housed in the Louvre Palace, originally built in the late 12th to 13th century under Philip II. Remnants of the Medieval Louvre fortress are visible in the basement of the museum. Due to urban expansion, the fortress eventually lost its defensive function, and in 1546 Francis I converted it into the primary residence of the French Kings.

          <h4>Notre-Dame, Paris</h4>
          <p>Notre-Dame de Paris , referred to simply as Notre-Dame, is a medieval Catholic cathedral on the Île de la Cité (an island in the Seine River), in the 4th arrondissement of Paris, France. The cathedral, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, is considered one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture. Several attributes set it apart from the earlier Romanesque style, particularly its pioneering use of the rib vault and flying buttress, its enormous and colourful rose windows, and the naturalism and abundance of its sculptural decoration.[5] Notre-Dame also stands out for its three pipe organs (one historic) and its immense church bells.</p>
